Blood Simulator - Python GUI Implementation
========================

Spec - In general, eating food raises blood sugar and exercise lowers blood sugar. We have created a
simplified model of how these factors affect blood sugar. Write a simulator that accepts several
inputs of two types, food and exercise, each with a timestamp. The output should be a “graph”
of blood sugar over the course of the day, and a graph of the amount of “glycation” that
occurred during the day.

To see thresholds / high level logical calculations, see blood_simulator/config.py

Instructions - 
1) Clone the Repository
2) `make`
3) `make run`

Future Iterations:
1) Add in activity list, which populates every time a food/exercise is added
2) Clean warning messages
3) More tests
